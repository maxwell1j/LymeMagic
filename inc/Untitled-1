     Soon, cross a ladder stile to the right into woodland. This is the beginning of the Interest Trail which leads through\ woodland. \
     Eventually the Interest Trail follows to the right of a driveway, with the Cage on a hill up to the left.<br> \
     The Interest Trail soon leads down steps to a ladder stile. This is the start of Crow Wood. Cross the stile and continue to\ follow the trail. \
     Upon meeting a junction of paths, bear left.<br> \
     The trail soon emerges behind The Timber Yard. Walk around the left hand edge of the mill pond.<br> \
     Pass to the right of the main car park. At a fork in the driveway, bear right, to follow a driveway across a cattle grid and\ uphill.<br> \
     Soon a further car park is reached, at the entrance to Hase Bank Wood. Go through a gate, and follow the driveway down\ through Hase Bank Wood.<br> \
     Upon reaching the house at West Parkgate, pass through a gate and turn left down the driveway, and footpath to return to the\ starting point.<br> \
     The path soon meets a driveway. Turn left up the driveway, passing a house named â€œWest Parkgate .<br> \
     Continue up the driveway, as it bears left, across a cattle grid. The driveway now levels out. Follow the driveway to Green\ Farm.<br> \
     At Green Farm, where the driveway forks, follow the driveway to the right, to pass behind farm buildings. Take a narrow\ footpath to the right, which soon emerges at a ladder stile.<br> \
     Cross the ladder stile. You are now in Lyme Park. Follow the grassy path which leads diagonally uphill. <br>\
     Where the grassy path meets a driveway, bear left. Very soon after, follow the narrow grassy path down to the left, away\ from the driveway. You should be heading directly across an open field towards a ladder stile in the high stone wall opposite,\ about 100 yards away.<br> \
     The narrow grassy path heads down into a damp gully, then up again, to emerge at the ladder stile. Cross the ladder stile,\ and follow the path (signposted as NCW , the North Cheshire Way) along the top right hand edge of the field, with a high\ stone wall to your right. <br>\
     After crossing a few stiles, the path (still following the wall to the right) goes downhill. Upon reaching a driveway at the\ bottom of the hill, turn right.<br> \
     Follow the driveway to Elmerhurst Cottage. Bear right through a gate. A sign indicates that you are entering Lyme Park.<br> \
