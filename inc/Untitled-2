     Eventually the Interest Trail follows to the right of a driveway, with the Cage on a hill up to the left. \
     The Interest Trail soon leads down steps to a ladder stile. This is the start of Crow Wood. Cross the stile and continue to\ follow the trail. \
     Upon meeting a junction of paths, bear left. \
     The trail soon emerges behind The Timber Yard. Walk around the left hand edge of the mill pond. \
     Pass to the right of the main car park. At a fork in the driveway, bear right, to follow a driveway across a cattle grid and\ uphill. \

     The narrow grassy path heads down into a damp gully, then up again, to emerge at the ladder stile. Cross the ladder stile,\ and follow the path (signposted as NCW , the North Cheshire Way) along the top right hand edge of the field, with a high\ stone wall to your right. \
